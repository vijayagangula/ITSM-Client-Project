# ITSM-Client-Project
# Data Science Project
## Business Case:
ABC Tech is an mid-size organisation operation in IT-enabled business
segment over a decade. On an average ABC Tech receives 22-25k IT
incidents/tickets , which were handled to best practice ITIL framework
with incident management , problem management, change management
and configuration management processes. These ITIL practices attained
matured process level and a recent audit confirmed that further
improvement initiatives may not yield return of investment.

ABC Tech management is looking for ways to improve the incident
management process as recent customer survey results shows that
incident management is rated as poor.

Machine Learning as way to improve ITSM processes

ABC Tech management recently attended Machine Learning conference on
ML for ITSM.

Machine learning looks prospective to improve ITSM processes through
prediction and automation. They came up with 4 key areas, where ML can
help ITSM process in ABC Tech.

1. Predicting High Priority Tickets: To predict priority 1 & 2 tickets, so
that they can take preventive measures or fix the problem before
it surfaces.
2. Forecast the incident volume in different fields , quarterly and
annual. So that they can be better prepared with resources and
technology planning.
3. Auto tag the tickets with right priorities and right departments so
that reassigning and related delay can be reduced.
4. Predict RFC (Request for change) and possible failure /
misconfiguration of ITSM assets.
